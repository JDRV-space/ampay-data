## PART I: PERUVIAN LEGAL FRAMEWORK

### 1. Constitucion Politica del Peru

#### Articulo 2 - Fundamental Rights

**Inciso 4 - Freedom of Expression:**
> "The freedoms of information, opinion, expression, and dissemination of thought through spoken or written word or image, by any means of social communication, without prior authorization, censorship, or impediment of any kind, subject to the responsibilities established by law."

**Relevance to AMPAY:** Protects the right to disseminate public information. However, it establishes "responsibilities under the law," which include offenses against honor.

**Inciso 5 - Access to Public Information:**
> "To request, without stating a reason, any information one requires and to receive it from any public entity, within the legally established timeframe, at the cost entailed by the request."

**Relevance to AMPAY:** Constitutional foundation for collecting and disseminating government data. AMPAY operates under the protection of this right.

**Inciso 6 - Personal Privacy:**
> "That information services, whether computerized or not, public or private, shall not provide information that affects personal and family privacy."

**Relevance to AMPAY:** A limitation on data dissemination. AMPAY must publish only information pertaining to the public activities of members of Congress, not their private lives.

### 2. Ley N° 29733 - Ley de Proteccion de Datos Personales

#### Key Articles

**Articulo 4 - Principle of Legality:**
Data processing must be conducted in accordance with the law.

**Articulo 5 - Principle of Consent:**
General rule: consent of the data subject is required.

**Articulo 14 - Limitations on Consent:**
Exceptions that allow data processing without consent, including:
- Data from publicly accessible sources
- Data necessary for the exercise of public entity functions

**Articulo 18 - Right to Information:**
Obligation to inform the data subject about the processing of their data.

#### Exception for Public Sources

**Decreto Supremo N° 003-2013-JUS** (Regulation) defines "publicly accessible sources" in a restrictive manner:
- Telephone directories
- Professional association registers
- Official gazettes
- Media outlets

**IMPORTANT:** The internet is not automatically considered a public source. However, government transparency portals DO qualify as publicly accessible sources.

#### 2024-2025 Update

**Decreto Supremo N° 016-2024-JUS** (new regulation, effective March 2025) may contain relevant updates. Periodic review is recommended.

### 3. Ley N° 27806 - Ley de Transparencia y Acceso a la Informacion Publica

#### Fundamental Articles

**Articulo 3 - Principle of Publicity:**
> "All information held by the State is presumed to be public, except for the exceptions expressly provided for."

**Articulos 15-17 - Exceptions:**

**Relevance to AMPAY:** This law is the principal foundation for the legitimacy of the project. Voting records, attendance data, and legislative activity are public information that Congress is REQUIRED to make available.

### 4. Codigo Penal - Offenses Against Honor

#### Articulo 130 - Injuria (Insult)
Penalty: Community service (10-40 sessions) or fine (60-90 day-fines).

**Definition:** Offending or outraging a person through words, gestures, or physical acts.

**Risk to AMPAY:** LOW. AMPAY does not express opinions or value judgments about members of Congress. It presents only factual data.

#### Articulo 131 - Calumnia (False Criminal Accusation)
Penalty: 90-120 day-fines.

**Definition:** Falsely attributing a crime to another person.

**Risk to AMPAY:** MINIMAL. AMPAY does not accuse anyone of crimes. It only reports voting records and positions.

#### Articulo 132 - Difamacion (Defamation)
Penalty: Imprisonment (not exceeding 2 years) and fine (30-120 day-fines).

**Aggravated (via media):** Imprisonment (1-3 years) and fine (120-365 day-fines).

**Definition:** Attributing to a person a fact, quality, or conduct that may harm their honor or reputation.

**Risk to AMPAY:** MEDIUM. This is the primary risk. A member of Congress could allege that the presentation of their voting record damages their reputation.

#### Applicable Legal Defenses

1. **Truth (Exceptio Veritatis):** If the information is true, it cannot constitute defamation. AMPAY must ensure the accuracy of the data.

2. **Public Interest:** Information about public officials in the exercise of their functions enjoys enhanced protection.

3. **Good Faith:** Acting without intent to defame (animus difamandi).

4. **Public Source:** The information originates from official government sources.

**Source:** Codigo Penal peruano, D. Leg. N° 635

### 5. Recent Developments (2023-2025)

#### "Gag Law" (March 2025)

The Peruvian Congress approved on first vote a bill that increases penalties for defamation and calumny. Press freedom organizations have criticized it as a threat to freedom of expression.

**Implication for AMPAY:** If definitively enacted, this would increase legal risk. It reinforces the need for:
- Exhaustive source documentation
- Robust disclaimers
- Avoidance of any value judgments

#### Electoral Roll Protection Law (2025)

A new law restricting the publication of sensitive electoral roll data (addresses, national identification numbers, photographs, signatures).

**Implication for AMPAY:** AMPAY does not publish electoral roll data; therefore, this law does not directly apply. However, it demonstrates the trend toward greater protection of citizens' personal data.

## PART IV: INTERNATIONAL BEST PRACTICES

### Comparative Analysis

| Organization | Key Clause | Applicability to AMPAY |

2. **Correction process:** Establish a clear channel for error reporting
3. **Data versioning:** Maintain a change log
4. **Last updated date:** Display when data was last updated

---

## PART V: OPERATIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### Before Launch

1. **Consult a Peruvian attorney:** Review by a specialist in digital/electoral law
2. **Verify initial data:** Accuracy audit before publication
3. **Implement gate page:** Do not allow access without acceptance

---

## PART VI: CONCLUSIONS

### Level of Protection Achieved

The legal documents prepared provide a **HIGH** level of protection against the identified legal risks, based on:

1. **Solid constitutional foundation:** Right of access to public information
2. **Regulatory compliance:** Ley 27806, Ley 29733
3. **International best practices:** Clauses proven in similar projects
4. **Informed consent:** Gate page with explicit acceptance
5. **Comprehensive disclaimers:** Coverage of all identified scenarios
6. **Demonstrable neutrality:** Absence of recommendations or value judgments

### Residual Risks

Despite the documentary protections, certain risks cannot be entirely eliminated:

1. **Strategic litigation:** A member of Congress could file suit to intimidate, even without a viable case
2. **Serious data errors:** A significant error could cause harm before detection
3. **Legislative changes:** The "gag law" or other reforms could increase legal exposure
4. **Judicial interpretation:** Peruvian courts could interpret the laws unfavorably

### Final Recommendation

**AMPAY has robust legal documentation, but the following are recommended:**

1. Review by a Peruvian attorney specializing in this area prior to launch
2. Civil liability insurance, if available
3. Protocol for responding to legal claims
4. Ongoing monitoring of legislative changes
